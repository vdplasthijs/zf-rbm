**We welcome you to reuse this code, and ask you to please cite our eLife article if you do.**

### Instructions:
- All figures were generated in whole by notebooks in `/zf-rbm/figure_notebooks/`. All other folders are just data for the notebooks and modules `figure_notebooks/` or archived code. 
- The package versions are documented in `/zf-rbm/zf-rbm-py37.yml`. 
- Some computing-intensive code is in another repo, `vdplasthijs/dnp-code/` -- in particular calculation of model stats vs experimental stats of Fig 2, and some cRBM-related stuff. 
- The cRBM code is extensively documented including tutorials in the repo `https://github.com/jertubiana/PGM`, and described in detail in our elife paper. 
- Data is available at `https://gin.g-node.org/vdplasthijs/cRBM_zebrafish_spontaneous_data`
